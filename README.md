# Calculator
## Gui programming assignment 2
This assingment was to make a Caulculator.

To use it, on the first line you start with a + or a -, then you add numbers and operators finally ending with a # to get the total.
For example `+2+2*4/5#` will give you `3.2`.

This program also supports saving the list of numbers, loading it back in and printing the list.
